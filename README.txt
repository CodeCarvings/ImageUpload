Piczard - .NET Image Manipulation Library
###  Image Upload  ###

This package includes SimpleImageUpload, an advanced image upload
user control with a powerful and intuitive image manipulation interface.

<ccPiczardUC:SimpleImageUpload runat="server" />

SimpleImageUpload user control allows the final user to:

- Upload an image to the server
- Interactively crop and/or resize the uploaded image
- Automatically apply post-processing filters (e.g.: image resize + watermark)
- View a preview of the uploaded image
- Edit a previously uploaded image maintaining the image parameters selected in the past (crop coordinates, resize factor, rotation angle, color adjustments, etc.. )
 
Since this control is provided as ASCX, the full source code is available.
You are free to change/edit it according to your needs.
